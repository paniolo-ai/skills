# Deployment Strategies Skill

## Use When

Use this skill when:

- Preparing or executing staging/production deployments.
- Updating environment configuration or secrets management steps.

Execution workflow:

1. Run pre-deploy quality checks before deployment changes.
2. Use the appropriate deploy command for the change type (including cache purge when needed).
3. Keep env/secrets handling aligned with existing Cloudflare workflow conventions.
4. Verify deployment health immediately after rollout.

Output requirements:

- Summarize deploy/config changes and affected environments.
- Include exact deploy and verification commands used.

## Common Scenarios

- Deploying API server to Cloudflare Workers or frontend to Cloudflare Pages
- Configuring environment variables for staging or production
- Adding new secrets or credentials
- Running pre-deploy validation

## Deploy Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
npm run dev:all   # Frontend: http://localhost:5173 | API: http://localhost:8787
```

### Pre-Deploy Checklist

Always run before pushing to production:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test:unit
```

### Deploy Commands

```bash
# Standard deploy
npm run deploy

# Deploy + purge CDN cache (use this for any user-facing change)
npm run deploy:full

# Staging
npm run deploy:staging
```

Use `deploy:full` whenever updating UI components, API behavior, or fixing bugs — ensures users see
new code immediately rather than cached versions.

### Verify After Deploy

```bash
# Check API is healthy
curl https://<your-domain>/api/health

# Tail live logs for errors
wrangler tail --env production
```

---

## Environment Configuration

### Frontend Variables

Set in `.env` (dev) or Cloudflare Pages environment (staging/prod):

```env
VITE*API*URL=http://localhost:8787          # Development
VITE*API*URL=https://staging-api.app.com   # Staging
VITE*API*URL=https://api.app.com           # Production

VITE*DB*URL=https://project.db-host.example
VITE*DB*ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### API Variables

Non-secret config in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[env.production.vars]
ENVIRONMENT = "production"
DB_URL = "https://project.db-host.example"
```

### Secrets Management

**Never commit secrets to git.** Use Cloudflare Worker secrets instead:

```bash
# Set a secret in production
wrangler secret put DB*SERVICE*KEY --env production
# (paste value, press Enter)

# List current secrets
wrangler secret list --env production
```

Local development secrets go in `.env` files (gitignored).

## Sub-Skills

- [Cache management + GitHub Actions CI/CD](../paniolo-cloudflare-cache-cicd/SKILL.md)
- [Rollback, monitoring, troubleshooting](../paniolo-deployment-operations/SKILL.md)

## Do Not

- Do not deploy to production without running `npm run lint` and `npm run test:unit` first.
- Do not commit secrets to git — use `wrangler secret put` instead.
- Do not use `deploy` (without `:full`) for user-facing changes.
  Users will see stale cached versions.
- Do not use for active incident recovery — load `deployment-operations` instead.

## Skill Handoffs

- If active production recovery is required, also load `deployment-operations`.
- If CDN cache behavior must change with deploy, also load `cloudflare-cache-cicd`.
